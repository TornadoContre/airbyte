// The safe_cast version of this file has a record with _ab_cdc_deleted_at = <invalid timestamp>
// which causes the record to not be deleted.
// This version obviously can't do that, so we just don't have any records at all.
// This file is just here so that we can have a comment explaining why there's no records.
